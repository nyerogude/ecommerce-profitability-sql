E-commerce Profitability & Cost Analysis – A Financial KPI-Driven Portfolio Project

This project simulates an end-to-end profitability analysis for an e-commerce business using **SQL** and **Power BI**, tailored for **finance-focused recruiters**. It showcases strong analytical thinking, financial KPIs, and data storytelling that reflect real-world decision-making scenarios.

Goal

To extract actionable financial insights using SQL and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) in Power BI — including **profit margin**, **gross profit**, **return on ad spend (ROAS)**, and **category performance** — just as a financial analyst would.

Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** – For writing advanced SQL queries across normalized tables  
- **Power BI** – For building interactive dashboards and visual analytics  
- **Excel 365** – For visual prototyping, export, and cross-validation  
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and professional portfolio sharing  

Data Structure (Simulated)

The dataset was designed to reflect common structures in e-commerce platforms:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `customers` | Customer demographics and signup dates |
| `products` | Product catalog with cost and selling prices |
| `orders` | Transaction log of product purchases |
| `returns` | Records of returned products and refund impact |
| `marketing_spend` | Monthly ad spend by marketing channel |

Project Objectives

- Track **monthly revenue, cost, and profit margins**
- Evaluate **top-performing product categories**
- Compare **new vs returning customer contributions**
- Analyze **product-level profitability**
- Measure **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends and KPIs

Key Metrics & Financial KPIs

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Revenue** | Total sales from completed orders |
| **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)** | Cost × quantity sold |
| **Gross Profit** | Revenue - COGS |
| **Profit Margin (%)** | (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100 |
| **ROAS** | Revenue ÷ Marketing Spend |
| **AOV (Average Order Value)** | Revenue ÷ No. of Orders |
| **New vs Returning Revenue** | Customer cohort revenue share |
