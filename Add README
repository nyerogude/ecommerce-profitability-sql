Goal: Use SQL to uncover financial insights and KPIs that drive e-commerce decision-making: *profit margin, ROI, CAC, revenue trends, returns, and product-level profitability*.

Data Structure (Simulated)

The dataset was designed to reflect realistic business conditions:

1. `customers`
Customer information including signup dates

2. `products`
Product catalog with cost and pricing details

3. `orders`
Sales transactions showing revenue, quantity, and fulfillment status

4. `returns`
Returned orders linked to products and dates

5. `marketing_spend`
Monthly spending by marketing channel (e.g., Facebook, Google Ads)

##  Project Objectives

- Calculate **monthly revenue, profit, and profit margin**
- Analyze **product-level profitability**
- Evaluate **marketing effectiveness (Cost per Acquisition / ROI)**
- Track **return rates** and their financial impact
- Visualize **monthly trends** and **high-performing channels or products**
